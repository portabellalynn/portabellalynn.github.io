you asked me what I dreamt about last night

i thought "I better make it interesting this time"

so I went to the kitchen and dug out the paper plates 

under the sink behind the 409 

and begun cutting the images out 

i asked our daughter to color them with pastels

and as soon as the coffee was done 

in my right hand 

i brought you some with cream 

and in my left 

all of my dreams
