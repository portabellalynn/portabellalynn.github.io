Be aware, watch the road, trust your nerves-




Here's to the good times and the bad. 

The ones who lost the fight and the ones still fighting 

Here's to my sisters and brothers 

My friends and my mentors

Here's to the fresh brewed coffee

Breakfast with a lover 

Toast with jam and butter




Let me feel this painful growth 

Let me hope forever and ever
