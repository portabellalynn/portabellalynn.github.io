After lying awake for a few too many hours last night worrying about all the diseases I could get from the dumpster lid I opened earlier that evening to toss my rubbage, I realized with great clarity that I need to stop watching so much T.V. So here online and in my personal notebook I have committed to a month of no television. I have drowned my sadness in it for too long and the only thing it ever did was make me more sad and make me more worried. Everyday, I will document what I do here (no matter how mundane) because 1)accountability 2)It's something to do besides watch T.V. 

Here it goes. 

With all my love and cheers,
