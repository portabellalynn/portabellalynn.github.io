I've spent most of my time on this earth pretending. I pretended I had had my first kiss. I pretneded I didn't understand. I pretended I finshed my plate of broccoli. So, I spend most of my time lying. Sometimes it still feels that way. Online now, i'm lying. I'm creating a persona of myself thats thoughtful and creative. I don't think that's true, that's not me. I think it's time for a bit of honesty in my life. I think it's time for a bit of confession. I am here to find out what I believe in because as of now the only thing I've worked toward in this world is learning how to numb myself. It's time to come off anesthesia.
