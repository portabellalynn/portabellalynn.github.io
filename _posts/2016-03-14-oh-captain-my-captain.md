title: "Oh captain, my captain!"
---

Since I was at work all of today-minus a few hours for my break-it was cake.  

I woke up around 730, guzzled down a big glass of water, and made some coffee. 
My client didn't wake up until around 830 so I just piddled around and got things in order around the house until then. Took my time to breath in the morning. Rough night sleep, bad dreams. 

My client and I went for our usual walk and work things kept me occupied until around 1, we then decided to go up to the office and visit with the other staff. There I argued with a coworker and bought some lunch (TJS! Woo)

After all of those thrilling events I finally went on my break around 3. Heres were I usually come home take a shower, make some tea, and pop on the telly for a couple hours to "unwind" (it's a 3 hour break since I work a 40 hour straight shift) Today was different. I came home, kicked off my shoes, made a whole french press full of mint hibiscus tea and read-for two hours. It was phenomenal. I then listend to a Moth (podcast) which made me cry and ate a banana bread muffin. My mind felt less muddled and I seemed to be much more prepared to go back to work. 

Work things occupied me until my client went to bed around 7. After that, I slid in bed and read agian, wrote in my journal journally things and now, of course, am updating here.  

Honestly, today was too easy because of work. But I said everyday and so I am going to update EVERYDAY. I guess tomorrow will be the true test when I have the time to lay down idly while easy instant entertainment is just a click away. I'll be fine. Have faith in me captain! 

While working, however, I realized how much I do want to move on to the next step. Doing this, no matter how silly it may seem from the outside, is making it so I am aware and accountable for every minute of my day. It helps me utilize my time better and to see how much I can accomplish even though i've said I can't. 

I eventually want to read 5-10 books a week. 
Maybe 3-6...eventually.

Cheers.
