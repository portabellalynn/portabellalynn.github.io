Couldn't even make it past day two...but for good reason! I was away camping. So definitely no T.V. there. However, when I came back home sunday night I had the worst case of blues. From past experiences I know I usually get this way after a trip. It's so sad to be back home most of the time. Anyway, I watched an epsisode or two of bones but I was mainly getting my things ready for work. At least I'm being honest...right? Though today has been quite the doozy. I just woke up sour. My car randomly has a flat tire which is tremendously annoying so soon after buying it. I've also been researching colleges all day which just makes me feel like I'm reaching at nothing. I feel short and unwelcome and on the edge. 
S. sent me the number for a counselor. I should at least try even if my views these days tend to agree with "psychology (and its practitioners) is a sham". I shouldn't assume I know everything. 
Goodnight.
